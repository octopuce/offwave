It is a set of PHP scripts and classes that search and discover web applications in a web server.

It can detect many kind of CMS, Frameworks, Wikis, Forums etc., their version, and also their modules and their modules' versions.

Please note that this is only a library, although the demo/ folder contains sample code to use it.

The lib/Offwave/Agents folder contains the different detectors for each CMS/Framework/Wiki etc. and their versions
